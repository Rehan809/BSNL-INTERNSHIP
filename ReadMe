👨‍💻 About Me

Hi 👋 I’m Shaik Rehan, a passionate network & data enthusiast with hands-on experience in Power BI, Cisco Packet Tracer, and various networking tools.
I recently worked on a Campus Area Network project, where I designed and simulated a complete network topology using Cisco Packet Tracer, and built interactive dashboards to monitor network performance, device distribution, and data flow across different zones of the campus.

I enjoy bridging the gap between network infrastructure and data visualization, turning complex technical setups into meaningful visual insights that support better planning and decision-making.

🔹 Focus Areas: Network Design, Data Visualization, Network Analytics, BI Reporting
🔹 Tools: Cisco Packet Tracer,Git, Networking Utilities (Ping, Traceroute, IP Config tools)
🔹 Interests: Scalable campus network solutions, network monitoring, and analytics-driven infrastructure optimization
