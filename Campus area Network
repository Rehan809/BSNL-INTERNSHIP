🏫 Campus Area Network Project – Description

The Campus Area Network (CAN) project focuses on designing, simulating, and analyzing a fully functional network infrastructure within a campus environment.
The goal of this project is to establish seamless connectivity between multiple departments, administrative blocks, and labs while ensuring secure data flow, efficient bandwidth utilization, and centralized monitoring.

Using Cisco Packet Tracer, I created a hierarchical network topology that includes core, distribution, and access layers. The network design features routers, switches, wireless access points, and end devices configured to support both administrative and academic needs.

🧱 Key Features

🛰️ Hierarchical network design with core–distribution–access layers

🌐 Inter-department connectivity with proper IP addressing & subnetting

🔐 Secure configuration for routers, switches, and end devices

⚡ Efficient simulation using Cisco Packet Tracer to test connectivity and routing
